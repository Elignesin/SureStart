# SureStart
Edited for Action Items for 2/8/21


## Reflections

*2/8/21*
Through the SureStart program, I hope to further reinforce my skills in Machine Learning while learning new skills and concepts in Artificial Intelligence. I also hope to collaborate with the fellow members of my cohort and have a fun experience working with others and learning new skills from them.
