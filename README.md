# SureStart
Edited for Action Items for 2/8/21


## Reflections

*2/8/21*
Through the SureStart program, I hope to further reinforce my skills in Machine Learning while learning new skills and concepts in Artificial Intelligence. I also hope to collaborate with the fellow members of my cohort and have a fun experience working with others and learning new skills from them.

1. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning differ primarily in that, for supervised machine learning, training data which has already been labeled is fed in, and the model is adjusted on that "training data" so that it can make conclusions on new data. Conversely, for unsupervised machine learning, the model is given unlabeled data and has to find relationships and patterns within it.  
2. This is false because Scikit-Learn is simply a modeling library; it does not have tools to load and handle data, as Pandas does, or to visualize it like Graphviz does. Thus, it uses these libraries to manipulate and visualize data, but Scikit-Learn cannot iself visualize data without these other libraries being used.
